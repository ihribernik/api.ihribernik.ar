# TODO: Clean Architecture & Hexagonal Improvements

## Completed Tasks âœ…

- [x] Use dependency injection for repositories and services in FastAPI routes
- [x] Decouple domain and API models with mapping functions
- [x] Raise custom domain exceptions and map to HTTP errors
- [x] Use environment variables for configuration (e.g., DB URL)
- [x] Add .env example and update README with .env usage instructions
- [x] Add/Improve testing setup (unit, integration, in-memory repo)
- [x] Document architecture and best practices in README
- [x] Add more robust error handling (custom exceptions for other cases)
- [x] Review and clean up all imports and dependencies
- [x] Configure code formatting tools (black, isort)
- [x] Set up type checking with mypy and linting with flake8
